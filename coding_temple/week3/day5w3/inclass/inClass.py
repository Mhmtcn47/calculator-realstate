our are given a string. You must replace any occurence of the sequence coverage by covfefe, however, if you don't find the word coverage in the string, you must add covfefe at the end of the string with a leading space. (edited) 

"coverage" => "covfefe"
"coverage coverage" -> "covfefe covfefe"
"double space " => "double space  covfefe"
